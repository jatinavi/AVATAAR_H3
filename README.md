# **Scene Composition with Object Segmentation and Position Shifting**

## **Introduction**
In recent years, **object segmentation and manipulation** have become essential in various industries, such as **e-commerce**, **medical imaging**, and **autonomous vehicles**. By leveraging pre-trained models like **SAM (Segment Anything Model)**, this project automates image post-processing workflows, such as moving objects within an image based on user input.

This project demonstrates the use of **generative AI** techniques for **object segmentation** and **shifting**, allowing you to manipulate images without retraining any models. By applying these technologies, we can automate tedious tasks in product photography, medical imaging, and more.

### **Applications:**
- **E-commerce**: Automate product placement and enhance product photos by shifting object positions post-shooting.
- **Medical Imaging**: Segment anatomical structures for precise diagnostic tools.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Detect and segment objects in real-time for decision-making in self-driving cars.

## **Workflow**

This project is broken down into two main tasks:

1. **Object Segmentation**: Given an image and a user-defined class (e.g., "shelf"), the model segments the object and applies a red mask to highlight it.
2. **Object Shifting**: Using user-defined `x` and `y` pixel values, the segmented object is moved within the same image.

## **How to Run the Project**

### **1. Object Segmentation (Task 1)**
Segment objects in an image based on a class prompt and overlay a red mask on the segmented object.
```
python run.py --image ./images/example.jpg --class "shelf" --output ./output_images/segmented_output.png
```

### **2. Object Shifting (Task 2)**
Move the segmented object within the image by shifting it horizontally and/or vertically.
```
python run.py --image ./images/example.jpg --class "shelf" --x 100 --y 50 --output ./output_images/shifted_output.png
```

## **Results**

### **Task 1: Object Segmentation**
- **Performance**: The SAM model segmented objects within seconds on a CPU.
- **Challenges**:
   - Complex textures and overlapping objects reduced segmentation accuracy.
   - Objects in cluttered backgrounds occasionally resulted in missed segmentation.

### **Task 2: Object Shifting**
- **Performance**: The shifting task was successful for simple objects, but overlapping objects caused occasional artifacts.
- **Challenges**:
   - Large shifts sometimes led to object artifacts when interacting with background elements.

## **Future Enhancements**

### **1. User Interface (UI)**
We plan to implement a web-based interface using **Gradio** or **Streamlit**. This will allow users to upload images, specify objects for segmentation, and interactively shift object positions.

### **2. Model Fine-Tuning**
Fine-tune the SAM model for specific use cases, particularly for complex environments where background noise interferes with segmentation.

### **3. Image Preprocessing**
Enhance preprocessing steps (e.g., edge detection) to improve segmentation in cluttered or complex backgrounds.

### **4. Advanced Shifting Techniques**
Implement more intelligent shifting techniques that avoid overlapping objects and adapt object positions dynamically based on context.
